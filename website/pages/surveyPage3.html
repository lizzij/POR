            Now let us ask you to predict some important conditions about the
            week that the event will take place. We will give you 10 tokens to
            allocate to several categories. You should allocate more tokens to
            categories that you think are more likely and fewer tokens to
            categories that you think are less likely. That is, if you think
            that a particular category is extremely unlikely, you should put
            zero tokens. Similarly, if you think that a particular category is
            certain, you should put all the tokens in that category. If you
            think all of the categories are equally likely, you should put
            equal number of tokens in all of them. There are no right and wrong
            answers here, so you should place tokens according to your
            expectation. Note that each token represents a 1 in 10 chance of
            that category being likely.

            The event is expected to take place in the [second week of January].
             <b>What do you think the weather of the week will be?</b> Allocate 10
             stars given to you. To repeat the previous instruction, you should
             allocate more stars to categories that you think are more likely
             and fewer stars to categories that you think are less likely.
             That is, if you think that a particular category is extremely
             unlikely, you should put zero stars. Similarly, if you think that
             a particular category is certain, you should put all the stars in
              that category. If you think all of the categories are equally
              likely, you should put equal number of stars in all of them.
              There are no right and wrong answers here, so you should place
              stars according to your expectation. Note that each star
              represents a 1 in 10 chance of that category being likely.
